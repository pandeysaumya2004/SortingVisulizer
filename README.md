# Sorting Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms in action. Users can observe how different algorithms sort an array of elements step-by-step, making it easier to understand their functionality and performance.

## Features
###1. Interactive Visualization
Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms in real-time.

Users can watch how the array is sorted step-by-step, helping them understand the inner workings of each algorithm.

### 2. Multiple Sorting Algorithms
Includes popular sorting algorithms such as:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

And more!

### 3. Dynamic Controls
Adjustable Array Size: Users can modify the number of elements in the array to visualize sorting with different dataset sizes.

Change Speed: Control the speed of the sorting process to better follow each step.

Shuffle the Array: Users can randomize the array and start the sorting process over at any time.

### 4. Color-Coded Visualization
Each element in the array is color-coded during the sorting process:

Sorted elements are shown in green.

Currently being compared or swapped elements are shown in blue.

Pivot elements in algorithms like Quick Sort are shown in red (if applicable).

### 5. Performance Comparison
The visualizer can compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms in terms of time complexity and behavior on various datasets.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the user interface.

CSS: Styles the visualizer and array bars.

JavaScript: Handles the sorting algorithms and animates the sorting process.
